### Project Description
so we made a match making website.So on logging in to the site we directly go to a page where we find our match and from there we can view their profile.In case if we are signing up we move on to take a mbti test and after we can add our further details like interest,job etc.As the next step we move on to find our match and we can view their profile from there.

### The Problem statement
 The matchmaking website has a complex user flow, which may confuse new users, especially with the multi-step signup process that includes taking an MBTI test and entering personal details before finding matches.
